# Music Player App - C++

This project was written for a Object Oriented Programming course.
The app is divided into three parts because I implemented the OOP concepts as I learned them, each part being more complex than the previous part.

# Theme and used OOP concepts

This app represents a music player app, designed to manage users, usersâ€™ playlists, artists and songs on the platform,
allowing CRUD operations and class-specific functionalities and featuring a queue for music listening and an interactive menu. It provides examples of OOP principles, such as:

## Project 1:
- Constructors w/ all parameters, w/ some parameters, and w/o parameters
- Overloading operators for every class: <<, >>, [], ++, -- (both forms), ==, other mathematical and conditional operators
- Overloading operators to allow operations between 2 different objects from the same class (e.g. A and B are two playlists, and A + B merges them together) or between 2 different objects from 2 different classes (e.g. A is a playlist and B is a song or vice versa, and A + B adds song B to playlist A)
- Friend methods to assure commutativity (A + B = B + A) when overloading mathematical operators to allow operations between objects and to avoid violating the encasulaption principle
- Const and static attributes

## Project 2:
- Virtualization (virtual classes and virtual methods)
- Inheritance and multiple inheritance 
- Interface class used to facilitate I/O operations
- Polymorphism
- **Diamond inheritance problem**: Playlist is inherited by GeneratedPlaylist (concept: playlist generated by the app based on the user's activity and music taste) and CreatedPlaylist (concept: playlist made by the user with handpicked songs); SpecialPlaylist inherits GeneratedPlaylist and CreatedPlaylist
- Constant methods

## Project 3:
- STL library usage: vector, set, list (implemented a queue using list, in other parts the queue is implemented with Queue), map
- Template class and Template methods: data container manager with methods that allow searching and sorting for the following classes: Artist, Album, Playlist
- Interactive menu in console implemented using a **Singleton** class
- Exception handling and custom exceptions
- Upcasting and downcasting (using static_cast and dynamic_cast)
